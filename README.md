# 🖼️ Python Based Web App for Applying Image Filtering

🚀 **IMAGE FILTERING WEB APPLICATION USING PYTHON** 🚀

This web application allows users to upload images, apply various filters, remove noise, and adjust image properties. Built with Flask and OpenCV for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, it offers a smooth and user-friendly experience.

## 📖 Description

IMAGE FILTERING WEB APPLICATION USING PYTHON leverages Flask for the backend and OpenCV for image processing. This application includes three main functionalities:

1. **Image Filter**: Apply a variety of filters to an image, such as Grayscale, Smoothing, Edge Detection, Sepia Tone, Sharpening, Embossing, Invert, Posterize, and Thresholding.
2. **Remove Noise**: Remove noise from images using Median and Gaussian Filters.
3. **Image Adjustments**: Change the Brightness, Saturation, and Contrast of an image.
